I'm, just like many, the kind of person that keeps `N+1` profile accounts in Google Chrome as a way to keep things organized and in place. But, as for today, Linux does NOT have a way to keep separated launcher for each profile, which is somehow annoying since it 'just works' in windows for long time.

This script inteeds to solve this problem whenever I need to do a fresh install of linux (I use ARCH BTW) 

I'll try to develop this script in a perfomatic and out-of-box way, so there will no requirements.txt, only built in bibs.


This is just a side project and things will get sorted in the way. Hope to end this project and later on 'translate' it for pure bash.
